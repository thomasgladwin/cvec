# cvec
Interactive vector visualization tool

Little helper program I made to look at vectors, scrolling along with varying time windows. It works like this: there are two pointers, left and right, and cvec plots everything between them. The controls are the keys sdf and jkl. The keys s and f move the left pointer, j and l move the right one and d and k (the middle fingers) shift the whole window left and right. s and f move the left pointer left and right. j and l does the same for the right pointer. Clicking provides the sample, or if a sample frequency has been specified, the time.

A row-wise matrix can be given, each row being plotted separately.
